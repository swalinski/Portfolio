For Educators:
Problems are added by editing the text file, problems.txt. You may use the pound symbol to make notes on problems or answers, but the lines prefaced by # will NOT be picked up by the question system.


Installation Guidelines:
All OS versions of the program require Python 3.5 (preferably Python 3.6.1) and above, and the PIL/Pillow module. Further helpful information (especially for Linux users) regarding the installation of Pillow can be found here. [http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/installation.html]
 
For Linux (Ubuntu 17.04, but should work with distributions that use apt, and possibly distributions that use different package managers):
Make sure that Python 3.5+ is installed. You may need to run the program using the python3 command instead of regular python if Python 2.7 is already installed. 
With appropriate permissions, run the command: apt install python3-pil.imagetk
Run the program from your terminal program using the command: python(3) Problem_System.py

For Mac:
The default Python version on Mac systems is 2.7, which is not compatible. You will need to install Python 3.5+ for Mac and may need to run the program with the python3 command.
Install Pillow by typing the command: pip3 install Pillow.
Run the program from Terminal using python3 Problem_System.py

For Windows (7, 8.1, and 10):
Install Python 3.5+. If an earlier version of Python already exists on the system, you may need to use the python3 command instead of just python. 
Navigate to the "scripts" folder where your Python installation is. Open the command line and run "pip3.X install Pillow" (where X is the ending digit of your Python version) or "easy_install-3.X Pillow" to install the module. 
Run the program from the command line using the command: python(3) Problem_System.py
